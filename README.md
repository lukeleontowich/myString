# myString

Implementation of my own string class.
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate my learning from "C++ Templates and the STL" and "C++ Advanced topics". These two courses are offered through Linkedin Learning and were created by Bill Weinman. In his couse, Mr. Weinmen created his own string class with the purpose of being a light-weight lean class that is comparable in size as C-strings (instead of the large overhead of using the string class in C++). The goal of my project will differ slightly in that I will provide my string class with its own iterators so that it is compatible with the STL alogrithm library. If I can accomplish certain functionality with the algorithm library then I won't inlcude that functionality in my string class, making my string class lighter.
