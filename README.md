# myString
Implementation of my own string class.
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate my learning from "C++ Templates and the STL" and "C++ Advanced topics". These two courses are offered through Linkedin Learning and were created by Bill Weinman. Mr. Weinman in his course created his own string class with the purpose of being a light-weight lean class that is comparable in size as C-strings (instead of the large overhead of using the string class in C++). The goal of my project will differ since I want to include as many features as possible in my string class so I can practice all the concepts that I learned in these two courses. The goal will be to create a string class that uses the same function names as the C++ string class so that it is familar and easy to use. I will be using google testing framework to test this project as I go.
