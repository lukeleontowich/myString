# myString

Implementation of my own string class.
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate my learning from the "C++ Templates and the STL" and "C++ Advanced topics" courses on LinkedIn learning. These two courses were created by Bill Weinman. In his course, Weinman created his own string class with the purpose of being a lightweight, lean class that is comparable in size to C-strings (instead of the large overhead of using the string class in C++). The goal of my project will differ slightly because I will provide my string class with its own iterators so that it is compatible with the STL alogrithm library. If I can accomplish certain functionality with the algorithm library then I won't include that functionality in my string class, making my string class lighter.
